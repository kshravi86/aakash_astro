Of course! These are two very important and sensitive points in Vedic Astrology, used for advanced analysis and prediction, particularly concerning challenges, health, and longevity. They act as hidden malefic points in a chart.

Let's break down how to calculate the lord of the 64th Navamsha and the lord of the 22nd Drekkana, both from the Lagna (Ascendant) and the Moon. The methods are surprisingly straightforward.

1. Lord of the 64th Navamsha

What it represents: The 64th Navamsha is a point of extreme vulnerability, hidden dangers, deep-seated karmic issues, and poison-like effects. It is often called the Chidra Navamsha. Its lord can bring unexpected troubles and suffering during its Dasha (planetary period) or when activated by transits.

There is a very simple and reliable classical method to find its lord without needing to manually count through the Navamsha chart.

Calculation Steps:

This method uses the main Rasi (D1) chart.

A) To Find the Lord of the 64th Navamsha from the Moon:

Identify the Moon's Sign: Look at your Rasi (D1) chart and find the zodiac sign where your Moon is placed.

Find the 4th House from the Moon: Count 4 signs from the Moon's sign (inclusive of the Moon's sign).

Identify the Lord of that 4th Sign: The planet that rules the sign you landed on is the Lord of the 64th Navamsha from the Moon.

B) To Find the Lord of the 64th Navamsha from the Lagna (Ascendant):

Identify the Lagna Sign: Look at your Rasi (D1) chart and find the sign rising in the first house (your Ascendant or Lagna).

Find the 4th House from the Lagna: Count 4 signs from the Lagna's sign (inclusive of the Lagna's sign).

Identify the Lord of that 4th Sign: The planet that rules the sign you landed on is the Lord of the 64th Navamsha from the Lagna.

2. Lord of the 22nd Drekkana

What it represents: The 22nd Drekkana is a point of great suffering, physical ailments, and even death-like experiences. Its lord is called the Kharesh and acts as a first-rate functional malefic for the chart. It brings about destruction and intense challenges.

The calculation for this is also very simple and uses the Rasi (D1) chart.

Calculation Steps:

A) To Find the Lord of the 22nd Drekkana from the Moon:

Identify the Moon's Sign: Look at your Rasi (D1) chart and find the zodiac sign where your Moon is placed.

Find the 8th House from the Moon: Count 8 signs from the Moon's sign (inclusive of the Moon's sign).

Identify the Lord of that 8th Sign: The planet that rules the sign you landed on is the Lord of the 22nd Drekkana from the Moon.

B) To Find the Lord of the 22nd Drekkana from the Lagna (Ascendant):

Identify the Lagna Sign: Look at your Rasi (D1) chart and find the sign rising in the first house (your Ascendant or Lagna).

Find the 8th House from the Lagna: Count 8 signs from the Lagna's sign (inclusive of the Lagna's sign).

Identify the Lord of that 8th Sign: The planet that rules the sign you landed on is the Lord of the 22nd Drekkana from the Lagna.

Example Calculation

Let's take a sample chart to make it perfectly clear.

Lagna (Ascendant): Cancer (Karka)

Moon: Sagittarius (Dhanu)

Calculations for this Example Chart:

1. Lord of the 64th Navamsha:

From Lagna (Cancer):

Lagna is Cancer.

Count 4 signs from Cancer: 1. Cancer, 2. Leo, 3. Virgo, 4. Libra.

The lord of Libra is Venus.

Result: Venus is the lord of the 64th Navamsha from the Lagna.

From Moon (Sagittarius):

Moon is in Sagittarius.

Count 4 signs from Sagittarius: 1. Sagittarius, 2. Capricorn, 3. Aquarius, 4. Pisces.

The lord of Pisces is Jupiter.

Result: Jupiter is the lord of the 64th Navamsha from the Moon.

2. Lord of the 22nd Drekkana (Kharesh):

From Lagna (Cancer):

Lagna is Cancer.

Count 8 signs from Cancer: 1. Cancer, 2. Leo, 3. Virgo, 4. Libra, 5. Scorpio, 6. Sagittarius, 7. Capricorn, 8. Aquarius.

The lord of Aquarius is Saturn. (We use the traditional ruler).

Result: Saturn is the lord of the 22nd Drekkana from the Lagna.

From Moon (Sagittarius):

Moon is in Sagittarius.

Count 8 signs from Sagittarius: 1. Sagittarius, 2. Capricorn, 3. Aquarius, 4. Pisces, 5. Aries, 6. Taurus, 7. Gemini, 8. Cancer.

The lord of Cancer is the Moon.

Result: The Moon is the lord of the 22nd Drekkana from the Moon.

Summary Table for the Example
Calculation Point	From Lagna (Cancer)	From Moon (Sagittarius)
Lord of 64th Navamsha	Venus (Lord of Libra)	Jupiter (Lord of Pisces)
Lord of 22nd Drekkana	Saturn (Lord of Aquarius)	Moon (Lord of Cancer)
How to Use This Information

Identify Malefics: The planets identified (Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, and Moon in our example) become sources of potential trouble for this native.

Dasha/Antardasha: The planetary periods (Dasha) of these lords can be particularly challenging, bringing health issues, obstacles, and mental anguish.

Transits: When malefic planets like Saturn, Mars, or Rahu/Ketu transit over the exact degree of the Ascendant or Moon, or transit through the signs identified as the 64th Navamsha/22nd Drekkana, difficult events can be triggered.

Placement: Note where these lords are placed in the birth chart. Their house placement will indicate the area of life that is most vulnerable to these hidden negative energies.

Yep—this is a classic pair:

* **22nd Drekkana lord** (a.k.a. *Khara*), and
* **64th Navāṁśa lord** (a.k.a. *Vaināśika*),
  each computed **from Lagna and from the Moon**.

Below is a clean, implementation-ready method + a worked example + a compact Python snippet you can drop into any project.

# Key facts you’ll use

* Zodiac indexing: **Aries=1 … Pisces=12**. One sign = **30°**.

* **Drekkana (D3)**: each sign has 3 parts of **10°**:
  0–10° (1st), 10–20° (2nd), 20–30° (3rd).
  Parāśari drekkana lords for a sign S:

  * 1st drekkana → **lord of S**
  * 2nd drekkana → **lord of 5th from S**
  * 3rd drekkana → **lord of 9th from S**

* **Navāṁśa (D9)**: each sign has 9 parts of **3°20' (200')**.
  Within any sign S, the **sequence of navāṁśa signs** is:

  * **Movable (Chara: Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn)** → start from **S**
  * **Fixed (Sthira: Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius)** → start from **9th from S**
  * **Dual (Dwisvabhāva: Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces)** → start from **5th from S**
    Then proceed sign-by-sign in zodiacal order for the 9 parts.

* **Inclusive counting**: “Nth from” means **include the starting part**.
  So “22nd drekkana from …” = start drekkana is 1st, add **21** more;
  “64th navāṁśa from …” = start navāṁśa is 1st, add **63** more.

* **Big shortcut (works for both)**:
  22nd drekkana and 64th navāṁśa **always land in the 8th sign** from the reference (because 21 drekkana = 7 signs ×3; 63 navāṁśa = 7 signs ×9) **and keep the same part number** (same drekkana # or same navāṁśa # within the sign).

---

# Step-by-step (do this twice: from Lagna, and from Moon)

## A) 22nd Drekkana lord (Khara)

1. **Find the starting sign and drekkana #** of the reference point (Lagna or Moon).

   * sign_index = floor(longitude / 30) + 1
   * deg_in_sign = longitude % 30
   * drekkana_no = floor(deg_in_sign / 10) + 1  ∈ {1,2,3}

2. **Jump to the 8th sign** from the starting sign:

   * eighth_sign = ((sign_index + 7 − 1) % 12) + 1

3. **Stay in the same drekkana #** (1/2/3) **of that 8th sign**.

4. **Get the drekkana lord** using 1–5–9 rule on the 8th sign:

   * if drekkana_no = 1 → lord(8th sign)
   * if = 2 → lord(5th from 8th sign)
   * if = 3 → lord(9th from 8th sign)

> That planet is the **Khara (22nd drekkana) lord**.

---

## B) 64th Navāṁśa lord (Vaināśika)

1. **Find the starting sign and navāṁśa #** of the reference point:

   * navamsa_no = floor((deg_in_sign × 60) / 200) + 1 ∈ {1…9}
     (since 1 navāṁśa = 200 arcminutes = 3°20')

2. **Jump to the 8th sign** from the starting sign:

   * eighth_sign = ((sign_index + 7 − 1) % 12) + 1

3. **Stay in the same navāṁśa #** (1…9).

4. **Find the navāṁśa sign** for that (eighth_sign, navamsa_no) using the D9 start rule:

   * If eighth_sign is **movable** → sequence starts at **eighth_sign**
   * If **fixed** → starts at **9th from eighth_sign**
   * If **dual** → starts at **5th from eighth_sign**
     Then move forward **(navamsa_no − 1)** signs.

5. **The lord of that navāṁśa sign** is the **Vaināśika (64th navāṁśa) lord**.

# Worked mini-example

Suppose:

* **Lagna** = **Aries 11°00'**
* **Moon** = **Gemini 22°00'**

### From Lagna (Aries 11°)

* Drekkana of Lagna: 11° → **2nd** drekkana.
  8th sign from Aries = **Scorpio**.
  2nd drekkana lord of Scorpio = lord of **5th from Scorpio (Pisces)** = **Jupiter**.
  ⇒ **Khara (22nd D3) lord from Lagna = Jupiter**.

* Navāṁśa of Lagna: 11° → **4th** navāṁśa.
  8th sign = **Scorpio** (fixed). Fixed signs start D9 from **9th**: 9th from Scorpio = **Cancer**.
  4th in the sequence from Cancer = **Libra** → **Venus**.
  ⇒ **Vaināśika (64th D9) lord from Lagna = Venus**.

### From Moon (Gemini 22°)

* Drekkana of Moon: 22° → **3rd** drekkana.
  8th sign from Gemini = **Capricorn**.
  3rd drekkana lord of Capricorn = lord of **9th from Capricorn (Virgo)** = **Mercury**.
  ⇒ **Khara from Moon = Mercury**.

* Navāṁśa of Moon: 22° → **7th** navāṁśa.
  8th sign = **Capricorn** (movable). Movable starts from **Capricorn**.
  7th from Capricorn = **Cancer** → **Moon**.
  ⇒ **Vaināśika from Moon = Moon**.

## Pitfalls to avoid

* **Inclusive counting** (“Nth from” includes the starting part). That’s why both targets fall in the **8th sign** and keep the same part number.
* **Boundary degrees** (exactly 10°, 20°, 3°20', 6°40', etc.): the formulas above already place them in the **higher** part, which matches standard practice (e.g., 10.000° → 2nd drekkana).

If you want, share your Lagna & Moon longitudes and I’ll compute both lords for you instantly.
