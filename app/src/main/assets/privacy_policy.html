  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>This app (“Vedic Light”) does not collect, sell, or share your personal data. All birth details you enter are processed on‑device. If you choose to save horoscopes, they are stored locally on your device and are under your control.</p>

  <h2>Data We Process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Birth details you enter (name, date/time, and selected place) for chart calculation.</li>
    <li>Optionally, saved horoscopes (stored locally only).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>Saved charts are stored locally within the app’s private storage. You can delete any saved chart from the “Saved Horoscopes” screen.</p>

  <h2>Network Access</h2>
  <p>The app may use the system Geocoder to look up place names you type. This uses network connectivity but does not access your precise location.</p>

  <h2>Third‑Party SDKs</h2>
  <p>No advertising SDKs are used. Astronomical calculations may use the Swiss Ephemeris library.</p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>This app is not directed to children under 13. Do not provide personal data for children without appropriate consent.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions or requests (including data deletion), contact the developer via the Play Store listing email.</p>
