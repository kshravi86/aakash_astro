Of course. Here is a proper and detailed explanation for calculating the D60 (Shashtyamsha), including the classification of its divisions into benefic and malefic amshas.

What is the D60 or Shashtyamsha?

In Vedic Astrology (Jyotish), the Shashtyamsha (D60) is the 60th divisional chart. It is considered by many classical sages, including Maharishi Parashara, to be the most important divisional chart for fine-tuning predictions.

How it's made: Each zodiac sign (Rashi) of 30 degrees is divided into 60 equal parts, or amshas.

Size of each amsha: 30 degrees / 60 = 0.5 degrees, or 30 minutes of arc.

What it represents: The D60 is believed to reveal the most subtle and deep-seated karmic influences from past lives. It shows the "final flavor" or the ultimate result of a planet's promise in the main Rasi chart (D1). A well-placed planet in the D1 can give terrible results if it falls into a malefic Shashtyamsha, and vice-versa.

Crucial Prerequisite: The calculation of D60 is extremely sensitive. A mistake of just one or two minutes in the birth time can change the D60 Ascendant and the position of fast-moving planets like the Moon. Therefore, an absolutely accurate and rectified birth time is essential for its use.

The Calculation: Step-by-Step

The calculation differs slightly for planets in Odd Signs (Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, Aquarius) versus Even Signs (Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, Pisces).

Let's take a planet's longitude, for example, Jupiter at 18° 25' in Leo.

Step 1: Get the Planet's Longitude and Note the Sign

Planet: Jupiter

Longitude: 18° 25'

Sign: Leo. Leo is the 5th sign, which is an Odd sign. This is a critical piece of information.

Step 2: Convert the Longitude within the Sign into Minutes of Arc

We only care about the degrees and minutes within the current sign.

The longitude is 18 degrees and 25 minutes.

Convert degrees to minutes: 18 degrees * 60 minutes/degree = 1080 minutes.

Add the remaining minutes: 1080 + 25 = 1105 minutes.

Step 3: Divide by the Size of One Shashtyamsha (30 minutes)

Now, we find out how many 30-minute blocks fit into the planet's position.

1105 / 30 = 36.83

Step 4: Determine the Amsha Number

Ignore the decimal part. Take the integer part of the result, which is 36.

Add 1 to this integer. This is because the first amsha is from 0 to 29 minutes (index 0), the second is from 30 to 59 minutes (index 1), and so on.

So, 36 + 1 = 37.

This means Jupiter is in the 37th Shashtyamsha.

Step 5: Look up the Deity and Nature of the Amsha

Now we consult the table of Shashtyamsha deities. Since Jupiter is in an Odd sign (Leo), we count directly from the beginning of the list.

Looking at the table below, the 37th Shashtyamsha is Deva, which is Benefic (B).

Interpretation: Jupiter, a natural benefic, is placed in a "Deva" (divine, godly) amsha. This is extremely positive. It suggests the karmic undertone of this Jupiter is pure, helpful, and will manifest its results (wisdom, wealth, children) in a righteous and supportive manner, overcoming many obstacles.

The Rule for Even Signs

For planets in Even Signs (Taurus, Cancer, etc.), the counting of the deities is done in reverse order.

Let's take another example: Saturn at 22° 50' in Cancer.

Longitude & Sign: Saturn at 22° 50' in Cancer. Cancer is the 4th sign, an Even sign.

Convert to Minutes:

22 degrees * 60 = 1320 minutes.

1320 + 50 = 1370 minutes.

Divide by 30:

1370 / 30 = 45.66

Determine the Amsha Number:

Integer part is 45.

Add 1: 45 + 1 = 46.

So, Saturn is in the 46th amsha portion.

Look up the Deity (using the Even Sign rule):

Since Saturn is in an Even sign, we count the 46th deity from the start of the list, but in reverse order. This is the same as looking up the 46th name in a reversed list.

An easier way is to find the 46th name from the standard list. Looking at the table below, the 46th name is Poorna Chandra. This is a Benefic (B) amsha.

Interpretation: Saturn, a natural malefic, is placed in a "Poorna Chandra" (Full Moon) amsha, which is highly benefic. This is a major mitigating factor. It suggests that while Saturn may still bring delays, discipline, and hard work (its natural significations), the underlying karmic result will ultimately be positive, nourishing, and complete. It softens the harshness of Saturn significantly.

Table of Shashtyamsha (D60) Deities and Their Nature

Here is the standard list of the 60 amshas, their names, and their general classification as Benefic (B) or Malefic (M).

Note: Some traditions might have minor variations in names or classifications, but this is the most widely accepted list based on Parashara.

Summary of Interpretation Principles

Benefic Planets in Benefic Amshas: This is the best possible placement (e.g., Jupiter in Deva or Venus in Amrita). It indicates a pure and positive past karma that allows the planet to give its best results smoothly.

Benefic Planets in Malefic Amshas: This is problematic (e.g., Jupiter in Rakshasa or Venus in Ghora). The planet's positive significations are corrupted. The person may gain wealth (Jupiter) but through cruel means (Rakshasa), or find love (Venus) that is destructive (Ghora). The good promise of the D1 chart is spoiled.

Malefic Planets in Malefic Amshas: This is extremely difficult (e.g., Saturn in Kulaghna or Mars in Vahni). It amplifies the negative qualities of the planet, indicating severe and challenging karmic patterns that will manifest with great intensity.

Malefic Planets in Benefic Amshas: This is a major saving grace (e.g., Saturn in Saumya or Mars in Kubera). The harshness of the malefic is softened and channeled toward a more constructive purpose. The hard work of Saturn leads to gentle and good results; the aggression of Mars is used to protect and generate wealth

Yep—here’s a clean, reproducible way to calculate a planet’s D60 (Śaṣṭyāṁśa) and decide whether its aṁśa is benefic (Saumya/Shubha) or malefic (Krūra).

# How to compute the D60 aṁśa number

1. **Reduce to sign-longitude.** Take the planet’s zodiacal longitude and drop whole signs so you’re left with **0°–30° within its current sign**.

2. **Find the aṁśa index.** Each Śaṣṭyāṁśa is **0.5° (30′)**.
   [
   n ;=; \left\lfloor \frac{\text{deg_in_sign}}{0.5^\circ} \right\rfloor + 1
   \quad\text{(so }n\in{1,\dots,60}\text{)}
   ]
   Example: 13°17′ in a sign → 13.283° / 0.5 = 26.566 → **n = 27**. ([barbarapijan.com][1])

3. **(Optional) Name of the Śaṣṭyāṁśa.** The 60 names run in order for **odd signs** (Aries, Gemini, …) and **reverse** for **even signs** (Taurus, Cancer, …). Use a standard table; just remember *forward for odd, reverse for even*. ([barbarapijan.com][1])

# Benefic vs malefic aṁśas (what’s “Saumya” and what’s “Krūra”)

The classical, citable rule comes from **Phaladīpikā 3.5**:

* **For odd signs** (Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, Aquarius), the **Krūra (malefic) Śaṣṭyāṁśas** are:
  **1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 48, 51, 52, 59.**
  All others are **Saumya (benefic)**. ([Medium][2])

* **For even signs**, **Phaladīpikā** says it’s **reversed**: the numbers listed above become **Saumya**, and the remaining numbers become **Krūra**. (Yes—this makes many even-sign aṁśas “tougher” under a strict reading.) ([Medium][2])

### Notes on textual variants (why lists differ online)

You’ll see two common variations in modern sources:

* Some tables print **18** instead of **16** in the odd-sign Krūra list due to edition differences. ([shubhamalock.com][3])
* **G.S. Kapoor** treats **24 aṁśas as malefic overall**, while **Gopesh Kumar Ojha** gives **24 malefic in odd signs** but **34 malefic in even signs** (an interpretive departure from the simple “reverse” rule). If you follow Ojha, the explicit even-sign malefics are:
  **3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 36, 37, 38, 41, 45, 46, 47, 49, 50, 53, 54, 55, 56, 59, 60.** ([trendingastro.com][4])

# Quick worked example

Say **Venus = 18°14′ Leo** (odd sign).

* deg_in_sign = 18.233° → n = floor(18.233/0.5)+1 = 37.
* In the odd-sign list above, 37 is **not** Krūra → **Saumya (benefic)**.
  If the same 18°14′ were in **Cancer** (even sign), **Phaladīpikā’s reversal** makes **37 Krūra** (malefic) for that placement. ([Medium][2])

# Two crucial cautions

* **Birth-time sensitivity:** 0.5° of ecliptic equals ~**2 minutes of clock time** at the ascendant—so D60 flips fast. Don’t lean on D60 unless the birth time is well-rectified. ([The Times of India][5])
* **Name mapping varies across texts** (BPHS, Jātaka Tattva, Sarvārtha-Chintāmaṇi). Use a single, consistent table for the 60 names and the odd/even reversal when you label the aṁśa. ([ia903205.us.archive.org][6])

If you want, I can also give you a tiny snippet that takes a planet’s longitude + sign parity and returns: **(a)** the D60 aṁśa number, **(b)** Saumya/Krūra per your chosen rule (Phaladīpikā “reverse” vs. Ojha/Kapoor), and **(c)** the aṁśa name from a standard table.
